# Notify Failure Action

This action sends failure notifications for deployment failures across multiple channels with comprehensive error reporting.

## Purpose

Provides immediate notification of deployment failures with detailed error information, helping teams quickly identify and resolve issues.

## How it works

The action sends failure notifications through multiple channels:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Creates detailed failure tracking issues
2. **Email Notifications**: Sends failure alerts to stakeholders
3. **Logging**: Provides comprehensive error logs
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of notification failures

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `environment` | Environment that failed deployment | Yes | - |
| `version` | Version that failed to deploy | No | `N/A` |
| `brevo-smtp-user` | Brevo SMTP username | Yes | - |
| `brevo-smtp-key` | Brevo SMTP password | Yes | - |

## Outputs

This action has no outputs - it sends notifications directly.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Notify failure
  if: failure()
  uses: ./.github/actions/notify-failure
  with:
    environment: ${{ steps.env.outputs.environment }}
    version: ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
    brevo-smtp-user: ${{ secrets.BREVO_SMTP_USER }}
    brevo-smtp-key: ${{ secrets.BREVO_SMTP_KEY }}
```

## Notification Channels

### GitHub Issues
- **Purpose**: Track deployment failures

## Notification Content

### GitHub Issue

```

### Email Notification
- **Subject**: `‚ùå Production Deployment Failed - owner/repo`

## Error Handling

The action includes robust error handling:

- **Permission Failures**: Graceful handling when GitHub permissions are insufficient
- **Email Failures**: Continues execution even if email fails
- **Missing Data**: Handles cases where version or branch information is unavailable
- **Fallback Values**: Uses `N/A` for missing information

## Best Practices

1. **Immediate Notification**: Failures are reported immediately
2. **Rich Context**: Include all relevant failure information
3. **Actionable Information**: Provide clear next steps
4. **Error Resilience**: Handle notification failures gracefully
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging for compliance

## Dependencies

- GitHub API access (for issues)
- Brevo SMTP credentials
- Deployment information from previous steps
