# Notify Success Action

This action sends success notifications for successful deployments across different channels.

## Purpose

Provides comprehensive notification coverage for successful deployments, including GitHub comments, email notifications, and logging for audit trails.

## How it works

The action sends notifications through multiple channels:

1. **GitHub Comments**: Creates comments on pull requests
2. **Email Notifications**: Sends success emails to stakeholders
3. **Logging**: Provides detailed logs for monitoring
4. **Summary**: Creates deployment summary

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `environment` | Environment that was deployed | Yes | - |
| `registry` | Docker registry URL | Yes | - |
| `image-name` | Docker image name | Yes | - |
| `version` | Version that was deployed | Yes | - |
| `brevo-smtp-user` | Brevo SMTP username | Yes | - |
| `brevo-smtp-key` | Brevo SMTP password | Yes | - |

## Outputs

This action has no outputs - it sends notifications directly.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Notify success
  if: success()
  uses: ./.github/actions/notify-success
  with:
    environment: ${{ steps.env.outputs.environment }}
    registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
    image-name: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}
    version: ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
    brevo-smtp-user: ${{ secrets.BREVO_SMTP_USER }}
    brevo-smtp-key: ${{ secrets.BREVO_SMTP_KEY }}
```
