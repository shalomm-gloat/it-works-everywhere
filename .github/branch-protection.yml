# Branch Protection Configuration
# This file documents the branch protection rules for our sophisticated branching strategy
# 
# IMPORTANT: These rules must be configured manually in GitHub Settings â†’ Branches
# GitHub Actions cannot automatically configure branch protection as it requires 
# organization-level permissions.
