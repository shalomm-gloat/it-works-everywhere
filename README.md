# It Works On My Machine - Production-Ready CI/CD

A Node.js Express microservice demonstrating **production-ready CI/CD practices** with automated testing, security scanning, and containerized deployment.

## 🎯 Phase 1: Setup & Foundation

### ✅ What's Implemented

- **✅ Public GitHub Repository**: Complete source code with proper version control
- **✅ Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with quality gates
- **✅ Production-Ready Deployment**: Docker containerization with Docker Hub
- **✅ Automated Testing**: Unit tests, linting, and health checks
- **✅ Security Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning and dependency auditing

## 🚀 Phase 2: Full CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

### ✅ Must-Have Elements

- **✅ Automated Testing**: Jest unit tests with coverage thresholds
- **✅ Code Quality Gates**: ESLint with strict rules and automated checks
- **✅ Branching Strategy**: Protected branches with PR requirements (main/staging/develop)
- **✅ Versioning Strategy**: Semantic versioning with automated release management
- **✅ Deployment Automation**: Zero-click deployments with Docker Hub integration

### ✅ Bonus Points Implemented

- **✅ Environment Progression**: Three-environment pipeline (dev → staging → production)
- **✅ Security Scanning**: npm audit for vulnerability detection
- **✅ Rollback Strategy**: Manual rollback workflow
- **✅ Documentation**: Clear guides and documentation
- **✅ Notification Systems**: GitHub notifications + Email notifications to PR authors
- **✅ Monitoring & Health Checks**: Automated health checks using test.sh

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd it-works-on-my-machine

# Install dependencies
make install

# Run locally
make run

# Run tests
make test

# Run linting
make lint

# Check health
make health-check
```

### Deployment

#### Development → Staging → Production
```bash
# 1. Development environment
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
git push origin feature/new-feature
# → Create PR to develop → Triggers CI/CD pipeline → Development deployment

# 2. Staging deployment
git checkout develop
git merge feature/new-feature  # via PR
git push origin develop
# → Create PR to staging → Triggers CI/CD pipeline → Staging deployment

# 3. Production deployment
git checkout staging
git merge develop  # via PR
git push origin staging
# → Create PR to main → Triggers CI/CD pipeline → Production deployment

# 4. Create a release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 📋 CI/CD Pipeline

### Branch Protection
- **`main`**: Requires 2 approvals, no direct pushes, linear history
- **`staging`**: Requires 1 approval, no direct pushes
- **`develop`**: Requires 1 approval, no direct pushes
- **Feature branches**: Free to push, require PR to merge

### Workflows
- **CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) → All protected branches
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) → Git tags
- **Rollback** (`.github/workflows/rollback.yml`) → Manual rollback

### Reusable Actions
The pipeline uses modular, reusable actions located in `.github/actions/`:
- **Core Actions**: Testing, Docker builds, deployment
- **Notification Actions**: Success/failure notifications with email alerts
- **Utility Actions**: Environment detection, release generation
- **Rollback Actions**: Version validation, rollback deployment

### Quality Gates
- **Linting**: ESLint code quality checks
- **Testing**: Jest unit tests with coverage
- **Security**: npm audit for vulnerability scanning
- **Health Check**: Application health validation

### Deployment Process
1. **Feature Branches** → Development environment (deployed)
2. **Develop Branch** → Staging deployment
3. **Main Branch** → Production deployment
4. **Git Tags** → Release deployment

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Application port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development, production)

### GitHub Secrets Required
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Health Check
```bash
GET /health
```
Returns application health status.

## 🐳 Docker

### Build Image
```bash
docker build -t it-works-on-my-machine .
```

### Run Container
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 it-works-on-my-machine
```

### Pull from Registry
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/<username>/it-works-on-my-machine:latest
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
yarn test
```

### Run Linting
```bash
yarn lint
```

### Health Check
```bash
make health-check
```

### Advanced Features
```bash
# Enhanced health check with rollback logic
make health-check-enhanced

# Create releases
make release-patch    # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
make release-minor    # 1.0.1 -> 1.1.0
make release-major    # 1.1.0 -> 2.0.0

# Show version information
make version
```

## 📈 Monitoring

### Health Endpoint
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- **Purpose**: Application health monitoring
