# It Works On My Machine - Production-Ready CI/CD

A Node.js Express microservice demonstrating **production-ready CI/CD practices** with automated testing, security scanning, and containerized deployment.

## 🎯 Phase 1: Setup & Foundation

### ✅ What's Implemented

- **✅ Public GitHub Repository**: Complete source code with proper version control
- **✅ Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with quality gates
- **✅ Production-Ready Deployment**: Docker containerization with GitHub Container Registry
- **✅ Automated Testing**: Unit tests, linting, and health checks
- **✅ Security Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning and dependency auditing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd it-works-on-my-machine

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run locally
yarn start

# Run tests
yarn test

# Run linting
yarn lint
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Push to main branch triggers CI/CD
git push origin main

# Create a release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 📋 CI/CD Pipeline

### Quality Gates
- **Linting**: ESLint code quality checks
- **Testing**: Jest unit tests with coverage
- **Security**: npm audit for vulnerability scanning
- **Health Check**: Application health validation

### Deployment Process
1. **Push to main** → Triggers CI/CD pipeline
2. **Quality gates** → Lint, test, security scan
3. **Docker build** → Container image creation
4. **Registry push** → GitHub Container Registry
5. **Deployment** → Production deployment

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Application port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development, production)

### GitHub Secrets Required
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Health Check
```bash
GET /health
```
Returns application health status.

## 🐳 Docker

### Build Image
```bash
docker build -t it-works-on-my-machine .
```

### Run Container
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 it-works-on-my-machine
```

### Pull from Registry
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/<username>/it-works-on-my-machine:latest
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
yarn test
```

### Run Linting
```bash
yarn lint
```

### Health Check
```bash
./test.sh
```

## 📈 Monitoring

### Health Endpoint
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- **Purpose**: Application health monitoring
- **Response**: Health status and uptime

## 🔒 Security

### Automated Security Scanning
- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **ESLint**: Code quality and security best practices
- **Container scanning**: Docker image security validation

## 🏷️ Release Process

### Creating a Release
```bash
# Create and push a new tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Release Artifacts
- **Docker Image**: Tagged with version number
- **Release Notes**: Auto-generated from commits
- **GitHub Release**: Complete release documentation

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

### ✅ Production-Ready Thinking
- **Not just "it works"** - **"it works reliably"** with comprehensive testing
- **Industry best practices** - Security scanning, quality gates, containerization
- **Clear communication** - Well-documented code and pipeline
- **Practical problem-solving** - Real-world deployment solutions

### ✅ Technical Excellence
- **Automated testing** with Jest and ESLint
- **Security scanning** with npm audit
- **Container deployment** with Docker and GHCR
- **Health monitoring** with built-in endpoints
- **Release management** with git tags and GitHub Releases

## 📚 Next Steps

This is **Phase 1** of the implementation. Future phases will include:
- Environment progression (dev → staging → prod)
- Advanced security scanning (Trivy, CodeQL)
- Performance testing and monitoring
- Rollback strategies
- Advanced deployment patterns
