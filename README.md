# It Works On My Machine - Production-Ready CI/CD

A Node.js Express microservice demonstrating **production-ready CI/CD practices** with automated testing, security scanning, and containerized deployment.

## 🎯 Phase 1: Setup & Foundation

### ✅ What's Implemented

- **✅ Public GitHub Repository**: Complete source code with proper version control
- **✅ Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with quality gates
- **✅ Production-Ready Deployment**: Docker containerization with Docker Hub
- **✅ Automated Testing**: Unit tests, linting, and health checks
- **✅ Security Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning and dependency auditing

### 📋 Important Assumptions

- **🚫 Server.js Constraints**: The `server.js` file cannot be modified as per assignment requirements
- **🧪 Testing Limitations**: The only functional application test available is via the provided `test.sh` script
- **🔧 Workaround Approach**: Unit tests use `curl` and `child_process` to test the running application

## 🚀 Phase 2: Full CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

### ✅ Must-Have Elements

- **✅ Automated Testing**: Jest unit tests with coverage thresholds
- **✅ Code Quality Gates**: ESLint with strict rules and automated checks
- **✅ Branching Strategy**: Protected branches with PR requirements (main/staging/develop)
- **✅ Versioning Strategy**: Semantic versioning with automated release management
- **✅ Deployment Automation**: Zero-click deployments with Docker Hub integration

### 🐳 Container Registry
- **Docker Hub**: [shalommeoded92/it-works-on-my-machine](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/shalommeoded92/it-works-on-my-machine/general)
- **Images**: Automatically built and pushed on every deployment
- **Tags**: Branch-based tagging (main, staging, develop, feature branches)

## 🏗️ **Scalability & Future-Proof Design**

### **📈 Horizontal Scalability**
- **Modular Actions**: Reusable `.github/actions/` components for easy extension
- **Environment-Agnostic**: Same pipeline works for any number of environments
- **Service-Independent**: Can easily add new microservices without pipeline changes

### **🔧 Easy Accommodation of Increasing Demands**

#### **More Code & Services**
- **Reusable Actions**: Add new services by reusing existing actions
- **Template-Based**: Copy workflow templates for new microservices
- **Centralized Config**: Environment configurations in one place
- **Docker-First**: Each service gets its own containerized deployment

#### **More Users & Teams**
- **Branch Protection**: Scales to any number of developers
- **Review Requirements**: Configurable approval thresholds
- **Notification System**: Scales to any number of stakeholders

#### **More Deployments**
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple services can deploy simultaneously
- **Environment Isolation**: Each environment is independent
- **Rollback Strategy**: Quick rollback for any deployment
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks for all deployments

#### **Additional Services Over Time**
- **Microservice-Ready**: Each service follows same pattern
- **Registry Management**: Easy to add new container registries
- **Service Discovery**: Ready for service mesh integration
- **Monitoring Integration**: Built-in metrics collection points

### ✅ Bonus Points Implemented

- **✅ Environment Progression**: Three-environment pipeline (dev → staging → production)
- **✅ Security Scanning**: npm audit for vulnerability detection
- **✅ Rollback Strategy**: Manual rollback workflow
- **✅ Documentation**: Clear guides and documentation
- **✅ Notification Systems**: GitHub notifications + Email notifications to PR authors
- **✅ Monitoring & Health Checks**: Automated health checks using test.sh

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Manual Setup Required

Before using the CI/CD pipeline, you must configure branch protection rules manually:

1. **Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Branches**
2. **Add branch protection rules for each protected branch:**
   - **`main`**: Require PR, 1 approval, no direct pushes
   - **`staging`**: Require PR, 1 approval, no direct pushes  
   - **`develop`**: Require PR, 1 approval, no direct pushes

> **Note**: GitHub Actions cannot automatically configure branch protection as it requires organization-level settings and I use the free version :)

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd it-works-on-my-machine

# Install dependencies
make install

# Run locally
make run

# Run tests
make test

# Run linting
make lint

# Check health
make health-check
```

### Deployment

#### Development → Staging → Production
```bash
# 1. Development environment
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
git push origin feature/new-feature
# → Create PR to develop → Triggers CI/CD pipeline → Development deployment

# 2. Staging deployment
git checkout develop
git merge feature/new-feature  # via PR
git push origin develop
# → Create PR to staging → Triggers CI/CD pipeline → Staging deployment

# 3. Production deployment
git checkout staging
git merge develop  # via PR
git push origin staging
# → Create PR to main → Triggers CI/CD pipeline → Production deployment
```

> **Manual Setup Required**: Configure branch protection rules in GitHub Settings → Branches to enforce PR requirements and approvals.

# 4. Create a release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 📋 CI/CD Pipeline

### Branch Protection
- **`main`**: Requires 1 approval, no direct pushes, linear history
- **`staging`**: Requires 1 approval, no direct pushes
- **`develop`**: Requires 1 approval, no direct pushes
- **Feature branches**: Free to push, require PR to merge

> **Note**: Branch protection rules must be configured manually in GitHub Settings → Branches. GitHub Actions cannot automatically configure branch protection as it requires organization-level permissions.

### Workflows
- **CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) → All protected branches
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) → Git tags
- **Rollback** (`.github/workflows/rollback.yml`) → Manual rollback

### Reusable Actions
The pipeline uses modular, reusable actions located in `.github/actions/`:
- **Core Actions**: Testing, Docker builds, deployment
- **Notification Actions**: Success/failure notifications with email alerts
- **Utility Actions**: Environment detection, release generation
- **Rollback Actions**: Version validation, rollback deployment

### 🐳 Container Images
All container images are automatically built and pushed to:
- **Registry**: [Docker Hub - shalommeoded92/it-works-on-my-machine](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/shalommeoded92/it-works-on-my-machine/general)
- **Build Process**: Multi-stage Docker builds with security scanning
- **Deployment**: Images pulled from registry for each environment

### Quality Gates
- **Linting**: ESLint code quality checks
- **Testing**: Jest unit tests with coverage (using `test.sh` for functional testing)
- **Security**: npm audit for vulnerability scanning
- **Health Check**: Application health validation via `test.sh` script

### 🧪 Testing Strategy
Due to assignment constraints:
- **Server.js**: Cannot be modified (kept as original)
- **Functional Testing**: Uses provided `test.sh` script via `curl`
- **Unit Tests**: Work around limitations using `child_process` and `curl`
- **Health Checks**: Leverage existing `/health` endpoint

### Deployment Process
1. **Feature Branches** → Development environment (deployed)
2. **Develop Branch** → Staging deployment
3. **Main Branch** → Production deployment
4. **Git Tags** → Release deployment

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Application port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development, production)

### GitHub Secrets Required
